 * Composite pattern lets clients treat the individual objects in a uniform manner.

 * 
 * Example:
 * Every sentence is composed of words which are in turn composed of characters. Each of these objects is printable and they can 
 * have something printed before or after them like sentence always ends with full stop and word always has space before it.

 * Composite design pattern is a structural pattern which modifies the structure of an object. 
 * This pattern is most suitable in cases where you need to work with objects which form a tree like hierarchy. 
 * In that tree, each node/object (except root node) is either composite or leaf node. 
 * Implementing the composite pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
